## Credits

I turned to ChatGPT for assistance debugging a few times. The biggest help was with my fetchForecastData function on script.js line 81. It helped me massively with figuring out why I couldn't get the 5-day forecast to display more than one day.
It also helped with setting up the CSS like I wanted it to be for the forecast and with making a responsive layout.
